## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow 

### What I learned

I have actually been having issues with making pictures responsive but i learnt to just allow the browser work for you in a way. And i'm getting better at making responsive pages. I know this is a simple website but still i'm happy i was able to make it responsive ðŸ˜Š

### Continued development

I obviously still need to work on making pages more responsive and know how to work with images better.
